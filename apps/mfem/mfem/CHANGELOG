Version 2.0, released on Nov 18, 2011
=====================================

Arbitrary order finite element spaces
-------------------------------------
- Added support for arbitrary high-order finite element spaces through the new
  classes H1_FECollection, L2_FECollection, RT_FECollection and ND_FECollection.
  These are based on a number of new FiniteElement sub-classes H1_*, L2_*, RT_*
  and ND_* elements of arbitrary order on all types of reference elements.

- The classes implement H1-conforming, L2-discontinuous, H(div)-conforming
  Raviart-Thomas and H(curl)-conforming Nedelec elements on triangular,
  quadrilateral, tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes. The only restriction on the
  order of the spaces is the availability of the required quadrature rules.

NURBS meshes and discretization spaces
--------------------------------------
- Added a collection of classes for serial and parallel meshes and
  discretization spaces using Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) basis
  functions (files mesh/nurbs.?pp).

- The Mesh class supports the NURBS-specific refinement functions: KnotInsert
  and DegreeElevate. Example NURBS meshes can found in the 'data' directory with
  file names *-nurbs.mesh including an exact non-degenerate disc
  (disc-nurbs.mesh) and exact non-degenerate ball (ball-nurbs.mesh).

- We can handle arbitrary NURBS or standard, non-NURBS, finite element spaces on
  NURBS meshes. However, a NURBS finite element space requires an underlying
  NURBS mesh. Refinement of parallel NURBS meshes is not supported yet.

Discrete gradient, curl, etc. matrices
--------------------------------------
- Added a new class, DiscreteLinearOperator, that facilitates the construction
  of matrix representations for linear operators like gradient, curl, embedding,
  projection, etc. The corresponding local "interpolators" are similar to
  bilinear form integrators and derive from base class DiscreteInterpolator.
  Current interpolators include GradientInterpolator, IdentityInterpolator,
  CurlInterpolator and DivergenceInterpolator.

- Also available is a parallel version of DiscreteLinearOperator, which
  assembles parallel topological matrices (such as the discrete gradient, curl,
  etc.) in hypre's ParCSR format.

New integrators
---------------
- New linear (r.h.s.) integrator VectorFEBoundaryFluxLFIntegrator for
  assembling (u, v.n) on the boundary for scalar u and v in an RT space.

- New bilinear integrator VectorFECurlIntegrator for assembling (curl u, v) for
  u in a ND space and v in an RT space.

New and updated examples
------------------------
- Added a new serial/parallel Example code 4/4p, which solves a 2D or 3D H(Div)
  diffusion problem using the Raviart-Thomas finite elements. In parallel, the
  linear system is solved with the brand-new Auxiliary-space Divergence Solver
  (ADS) in hypre.

- Modified Example 1 to use isoparametric discretization (use the FE space from
  the mesh) including NURBS meshes and spaces.  Updated Example 2 to support
  arbitrary order spaces. Updated all examples to work with NURBS meshes and
  spaces, as well as to not use projection onto discontinuous polynomial spaces
  for visualization (this is now handled directly in GLVis when necessary).

- In all examples, switched to a uniform "solution" socket data type instead of
  the various previous "*_gf_data" data types.

- In the parallel examples, switched to parallel mesh and solution output, as
  well as to the new parallel socket format in place of PrintAsOne/SaveAsOne.

New hypre solvers
-----------------
- The parallel MFEM build now requires hypre 2.8.0b or newer.

- Extended HypreAMS and HypreADS to support (arbitrary) high-order ND/RT spaces,
  by internally constructing the high-order ParDiscreteLinearOperator gradient,
  curl and interpolation matrices. This makes the linear solve in Example 3p and
  4p significantly faster than before. Extended the HypreAMS object to also work
  for 2D H(div) problems.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Added new class socketstream implementing two-way tcp/ip socket communications
  in the framework of C++ streams. Added new class socketserver implementing
  tcp/ip server functionality: listen on a given port for incoming connections,
  and accept them by assigning the new connection to a socketstream. These new
  classes are meant to replace the classes isockstream and osockstream. They
  allow MFEM code to update the mesh and solution via a single socket connection
  to a GLVis window.

- Added new Mesh and GridFunction constructors that combine multiple Mesh and
  GridFunction objects into one object. These are used in GLVis to visualize
  data saved in parallel. Removed obsolete code related to reading of parallel
  disjoint meshes.

- Added more quadrature rules on triangles and tetrahedra.

- Basic experimental OpenMP support (disabled by default). When enabled, OpenMP
  code is used for local matrix assembly, sparse matrix-vector product, and some
  vector operations.

- Added support for METIS 5.0 (not the default, see INSTALL).

- Various simplifications, extensions, and bugfixes in the code.


Version 1.2, released on Apr 08, 2011
=====================================

Parallel MPI-based version of the library based on hypre
--------------------------------------------------------
- New MPI parallel version of the library based on the ParCSR parallel matrix
  format from hypre and the metis graph partitioning library. This version
  supports parallel local refinement and parallel curved meshes, as well as
  several solvers from hypre.

New serial and parallel examples
--------------------------------
- Added a new example code describing an electromagnetic diffusion problem
  discretized with lowest order Nedelec finite elements (Example 3).

- Added parallel versions of all examples codes (files ex1p.cpp, ex2p.cpp and
  ex3p.cpp) based on hypre's BoomerAMG and AMS preconditioners.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Added support for saving and reading linear and curved quadratic meshes in VTK
  format. The format is automatically recognized when opening a mesh file, and
  the boundary is reconstructed based on the actual domain boundary.

- The 'data' directory now contains a collection of various mesh files in the
  MFEM and VTK formats, including curved meshes and the mesh files that were
  previously in the 'examples' directory.

- Updated the default integration rule order for most of the linear form
  integrators.

- Added support for cubic hex elements.

- Bugfixes in the face orientation of 3D RT0 elements and in the VectorFEDomain
  linear form integrator.

- Various small fixes and styling updates.


Version 1.1, released on Sep 13, 2010
=====================================

New MFEM format for general meshes
----------------------------------
- New MFEM mesh v1.0 format with uniform structure for any dimension and support
  for curved meshes including in 3D.  Class Mesh will recognize and read the new
  format (in addition to all previously used formats) and Mesh::Print uses the
  new format by default. The old print function was renamed to Mesh::PrintXG.

New elasticity example
----------------------
- Added an example code for linear elasticity with (high-order) vector finite
  elements (Example 2).

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Added Mesh::PrintVTK and GridFunction::SaveVTK methods for output in VTK
  format.

- Implemented GeometryRefiner::Refine for CUBE and TETRAHEDRON geometries. This
  allows for saving curved meshes in the VTK format.

- Added SConstruct file for mfem/examples.

- Various small fixes and styling updates.
