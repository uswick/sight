Installation
------------
run "make"

Dependencies
------------
gcc
g++
gfortran
make
cmake

Example codes
-------------
To view the results of the example, run "make runExamples". This executes the codes in
directory examples/, producing directories 
  sight/examples/dbg.1.StructuredFormatting/
  sight/examples/dbg.2.ConditionalFormatting/
  sight/examples/dbg.3.Navigation/
  sight/examples/dbg.4.AttributeAnnotationFiltering/
  sight/examples/dbg.5.Tracing/
  sight/examples/dbg.6.PerfAnalysis/

To understand the APIs provided by Sight please look at the source and the output of these
codes since each one focuses on a specific portion of the API.

"make runExamples" also executes the Sight-enhanced applications in directory apps/, producing directories 
  sight/dbg.MCBenchmark/
  sight/dbg.MFEM.ex1/
  sight/dbg.MFEM.ex2/
  sight/dbg.MFEM.ex3/
  sight/dbg.MFEM.ex4/
These illustrate how Sight may fit into a larger application, specifically CoMD and MFEM.

To view the output of a given run look at file dbg.*/index.html with Firefox (other browsers 
are currently not supported).

Using Sight in your application
-------------------------
In each .C file include the following:
  #include "sight.h"
  use namespace sight;

At the top of main() initialize Sight:
  SightInit(argc, argv, "App Name", "DirectoryToStoreDebugOutput");

In your Makefile:
  include sight/Makefile.extern

  sightApp: sightApp.C
  	g++ sightApp.C ${SIGHT_CFLAGS} -c -o sightApp.o
  	g++ sightApp.o ${SIGHT_LINKFLAGS} -o sightApp
