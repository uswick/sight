/* #################### DESIGN NOTES ####################
Clocks are a mechanism to associate a timestamps with each emitted tag. These timestamps must 
increase monotonically within a single process' log (they may be equal but never decrease) and
must be comparable across different logs, establishing a partial order between events between 
them. A simple example of a clock is real system time, allowing us to display tags in their
chronological order when we merge multiple logs. Another example is MPI where a clock is a vector
mapping each FIFO channel to the number of messages sent/received on it.

All sightObjs have one or more clocks associated with them and during the layout phase we
call their respective handlers to maintain the current time and to place divs into the generated
HTMLs to mark points where the time changes. These points can then be manipulated based on
their relative time values.

When merging or laying out logs Sight need to decode the tags that encode the different clocks. Each clock creates
a mapping between the names of clocks and functions that map their encodings to clock objects. This
is done by creating class that inherits from MergeHandlerInstantiator or layoutHandlerInstantiator. Each 
clock widget must create a static instance of this class and in the constructor of this class must map 
the name of its clock to a function called when a clock update is observed during either merge or layout.
widgets/clock_structure.C and widgets/clock_layout.C provide examples of how this mechanism is used.

//   links to anchors either before (forward links) or after (backward links) the anchor's output location has been 
//   reached. For backward links we can generate code easily since the anchor's target is known at output generation time.
//   To support forward links we do the following:
//   - When the output location is reached, we emit a piece of code to the script file that register's the location
//     in a data sctructure. There is one anchor script file for the entire output (not one per sub-file) to make it
//     easier to deal with anchors that cross files.
//   - When forward links are created we generate code that looks the link's destination in the data structure. If
//     the destination has already been loaded in the data structure, we go directly there. If the destination has not
//     been loaded, this means that the application generating the debug log has crashed and thus, we shouldn't follow
